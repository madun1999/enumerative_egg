# `rsmt2`

A generic library to interact with SMT-LIB 2 compliant solvers running in a separate system process,
such as [z3][z3] and [CVC4][cvc4].


If you use this library consider contacting us on the [repository](https://github.com/kino-mc/rsmt2)
so that we can add your project to the readme.

See [`changes.md`](https://github.com/kino-mc/rsmt2/blob/master/README.md) for the list of changes.


# Features

- [x] support main solvers ([z3][z3], [CVC4][cvc4], [Yices 2][yices2])
- [x] all basic declaration/definition/assertion/model/values commands
- [x] `check-sat-assuming`, with dedicated [actlit API]
- [x] the commands to run each solver can be passed through environment variables, see the `conf`
  module
- [ ] [alt-ergo][AE]
- [ ] `get-proof` command


# Known projects using `rsmt2`

- [kin≈ç][kino], a model-checker for transition systems (abandoned)
- [hoice][hoice], a machine-learning-based predicate synthesizer for horn clauses
